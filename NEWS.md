# conformalForecast 0.1.0

* First release.

## Initial features

* Provides implementations of the main conformal prediction methods:
  - `scp` (split conformal prediction)
  - `acp` (adaptive conformal prediction)
  - `pid` (conformal PID control method)
  - `acmcp` (autocorrelated multi-step conformal prediction).
* Includes utility functions to compute coverage rates and interval widths for evaluating predictive performance.
